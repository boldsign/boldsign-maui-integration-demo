# Integrate BoldSign API to Enable E-Signature Workflows in Your MAUI Mobile App

**Homepage:** [https://boldsign.com](https://boldsign.com)

.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a framework for building native apps for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows using a single C# and XAML codebase. 

It enables unified development with shared code across platforms, while still allowing platform-specific customizations when needed. Unlike hybrid frameworks, MAUI delivers native performance by compiling to native controls and accessing platform APIs through Microsoft.Maui.Essentials (e.g., GPS, Bluetooth).

If you’ve used Xamarin.Forms or Windows Forms, MAUI will feel familiar. Now, let’s explore how to integrate MAUI with BoldSign.
